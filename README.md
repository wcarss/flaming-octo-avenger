====================

was originally 'some kind of platformer', but github one-upped me on the name. Darn github.

I don't know much about making video games, and I know next to nothing about using SFML (the Simple Fast Media Library). But I'd sure like to! So I'm going to start off with the simple example file the SFML documentation provides, and slowly add things to it, until what I've got is some kind of platformer. I may get to that point and decide it's not enough, and add some more stuff or something, or maybe it'll just stagnate forever, like every weeknight project out here on the net.
